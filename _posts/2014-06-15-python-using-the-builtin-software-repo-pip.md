<code>Pip is the python equivalent of "linux redhat's yum"
</code>

&nbsp;

It comes included with python 3.4.

&nbsp;

it is something that you run from the powershell command line rather than within python terminal itself, e.g.



[powershell]
PS C:\Users\Mir\Desktop=> pip install -U selenium
Downloading/unpacking selenium
  Running setup.py (path:C:\Users\Mir\AppData\Local\Temp\pip_build_Mir\selenium\setup.py)
egg_info for package selenium

Installing collected packages: selenium
  Running setup.py install for selenium

Successfully installed selenium
Cleaning up...
PS C:\Users\Mir\Desktop=>
[/powershell]
