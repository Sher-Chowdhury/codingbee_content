A public IP address is not a static IP address, i.e. it will change if you reboot your EC2 instance

&nbsp;

Elastic IP Addresses on the other hand is persistant. you can assign to one instance, or at a later date reassign it to a different instance.

Inside a vpc we can have to types of subnets:

&nbsp;
<ul>
	<li><strong>Private subnets</strong> - This is a subnet that does not have an internet gateway attached to it. This means an instance Â can't access the internet via this type of subnet. This address is persitant and will survive a reboot.</li>
	<li><strong>Public subnets</strong> - This is a subnet that does have an internet gateway attached to it.</li>
</ul>
&nbsp;

In order for an instance to have internet access, it first needs to be in a vpc that contains a Public Subnet. The next thing it needs is either a public address or elastic ip address.

Attaching a Public/Elastic IP address to an instance is a bit like assigning an IP address to an instance's network card.

Elastic IP address works by associating itself to a public IP address.

&nbsp;

It is possible for an instance to have a public/elastic ip address, but is a vpc that only contains a private subnet. In this situation, the instance will still not have access to the internet.

Therefore for an EC2 instance to have internet access, that instance needs to have a public/elastic IP address assigned to it, and the instance needs to also reside inside a public subnet.
