Yaml actually comes as part of the ruby core, therefore there is no ruby gem for it.  

Lets say you have the following yaml file:


<pre>$ cat /etc/credentials.yaml
---
:foreman:
  :username: 'codingbee'
  :password: 'liverpool'
</pre>
now you want use these content, then you do:


<pre>
cat yamldemo.rb
require 'yaml'

credentials = YAML.load_file("/etc/credentials.yaml")
@username = credentials[:foreman][:username]
@password = credentials[:foreman][:password]

puts @username
puts @password


</pre>

Which leads to:

<pre>
$ ruby yamldemo.rb
codingbee
liverpool

</pre>
