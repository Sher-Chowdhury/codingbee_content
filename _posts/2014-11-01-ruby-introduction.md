Ruby is a really useful language that is worth learning about, especially if want to master any of the following technologies that are built with Ruby:

- Puppet (Configuration Management)
- Cucumber (Automated System testing framework)
- Rspec (Unit test framework) 

<h2>Installing Ruby on windows</h2>

There are a few ways to install ruby on a windows machine. One option is just to install Ruby using the <a href="http://rubyinstaller.org/">ruby installer</a>. However I have often had issues when I wanted to do certain things which required a rails installation. I often found that installing rails separately from Ruby often causes all kinds of issues. That's why I have discovered that it makes like much easier if you install ruby and rails at the same time.  

This is possible thanks to the <a href="http://codingbee.net/tutorials/rails/rails-installing-rails-windows-machine/" title="Rails - Installing Rails on a Windows Machine">rails installer</a>. 

Ruby comes as part of Rails, so once you have installed rails, you can start using ruby as a standalone, and only use rails as and when you want to.
