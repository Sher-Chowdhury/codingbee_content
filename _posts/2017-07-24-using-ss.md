This show socket (ss) command is another command that you can use instead of the <a href="http://codingbee.net/tutorials/linux/networking/using-netstat">netstat</a> command. Here are some examples:


<pre>ss -at</pre>

This lists (a)ll (t)cp ports. 

<pre>ss -alt</pre>

This lists (a)ll (l)istening (t)cp ports.
