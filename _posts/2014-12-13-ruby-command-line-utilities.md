There are a bunch of command line utilities that comes with ruby and rails,

You can find them via your ruby/rail installation's bin folder, e.g. on a windows machine, your bin folders, could be something similar to:

C:\RailsInstaller\Ruby2.1.0\bin


Here are the main utilities you'll find in this folder:


<ul>
	<li>bundle</li>
	<li>bundler</li>
	<li>gem</li>
	<li>irb</li>
	<li>rails</li>
	<li>rake</li>
</ul>
