Modules are similar to classes, but with one key difference, modules can't be instantiated. 

modules can hold any combination of the following:

- methods  (which I guess will in this case be static methods) 
- classes 
- constants
- other modules


You drill down using the scope operator (::)


You can thing of modules as containers for organising all your code. In c# we use something similar, called namespaces.
