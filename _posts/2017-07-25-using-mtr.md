Sometimes that ping and traceroute command doesn't work due to network security reasons:

Note: I couldn't get arping to work either. 

That's where mtr can come in handy. mtr is a combination of the ping and traceroute command. 




<pre>
$ yum install mtr
</pre>


Then do:

<pre>
$ mtr codingbee.net
</pre>


This starts up a text based display (a bit like how the top command does) that is constantly refreshing. It looks something like this:
