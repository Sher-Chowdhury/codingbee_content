In the EC2 section of your AWS web console, there is a section called "limits". This sets arbitariry limits on things like how many running EC2 instance you are allowed to have at any given time. This limits are in place mainly for AWS own benefit to help them plan for the future. However you can put in a request to have these limits increased as and when needed.
