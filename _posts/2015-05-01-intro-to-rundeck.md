Rundeck can be use to run the same bash command, shell script, serverspec scripts,....etc....on multiple VMs at the same time. 

Can also be used to orchestrate puppet runs. 

There is a bit of an overlap on which tool to use, e.g. do a "passwd {username}"  using Rundeck to change someones password, or use puppet.
