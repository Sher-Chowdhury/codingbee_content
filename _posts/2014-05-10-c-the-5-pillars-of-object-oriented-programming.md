There are 5 concepts of OOP:
<ol>
	<li>Encapsulation</li>
	<li>Data Hiding</li>
	<li>Specialization</li>
	<li>Polymorphism</li>
	<li>Division of Responsibility</li>
</ol>
&nbsp;

&nbsp;
<h2>Encapsulation</h2>
This means that you can use a class without the need to view the code inside the class. All you have knowledge of the class, are it's exposed members.
<h2>Data Hiding</h2>
A class's internal data is not accessible from outside the class.
<h2>Specialization</h2>
This is related to "inheritence"
<h2>Polymorphism</h2>
This is related to "inheritence"
<h2>Division of Responsibility</h2>
This is to do with the fact that oop is designed to allow a team of people to develop a whole program together. First you design how the program will work in terms of what classes have to be written (along with what methods), then each class is assigned to a team member to develop.
