This is similar to s3, i.e. it is also used for storing data.

The key difference is that it can take several hours to retrieve data out of Amazon glacier.

Another big difference is that it is a lot cheaper compared to s3 or rrs version of s3.

it is  £0.01/GB per month.

or

 £1.00/TB per month, which works out to be  £12 for the whole year.
