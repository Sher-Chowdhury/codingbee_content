This is the <a href="http://codingbee.net/tutorials/c/c-instantiate-object-set-properties-simultaneously-using-constructors-approach/">c# equivalent of the constructur method</a>. 

In c# you don't have to explicitly define the constructor class, because it by default already implicitly specified in every class that you define, however in Ruby you do have to explicitly define it.

Also you invoke the initialize method by calling a special reserved method called "new"
